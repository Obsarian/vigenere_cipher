# VIGENERE CIPHER

Hello there!
This is a C program for the vigenere cipher. The program uses multiple files, using a make file. What this means is that there is a main file, where the main function is writen. The other functions are written in different files and the program entirely is compiled using the make file.
What is a make file? All thats required right now is that the make file makes the compilation easy.  
What is a vigenere cipher?
